        <h1> Us And Our Ancestors</h1>
        <body>
            <p>
                Humans evolved from monkeys, with our closest realties being the chimps. But as we go back up the 
                evolutionary tree we find more of distant ancestors like lesser apes and monkeys. We all evolved
                from a commen ancestor about 60 million years ago in Africa.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of our closest ancestor fall into the family of Simain (Higher Primates).

                        Old World monkeys, belong to the family Cercopithecidae and are primarily found in Africa and Asia.br <br> 
                        They have a diverse range of species, including baboons, macaques, colobuses, and mandrills. <br>
                        Unlike New World monkeys, they have non-prehensile tails and generally exhibit more complex social structures. <br>
                        Their diets are varied, often including fruits, leaves, and insects, and they are known to eat meat if given the option. <br>
                        Old World monkeys are also characterized by their narrow, downward-facing nostrils and are typically more terrestrial than their New World counterparts.</p>

                    <p>
                        New World monkeys are part of the parvorder Platyrrhini and are primarily found in Central and South America. <br>
                        They include species like capuchins, tamarins, spider monkeys and howler monkeys. <br>
                        Characterized by their flat noses with side-facing nostrils, they often have prehensile tails that aid in climbing and grasping. <br>
                        New World monkeys are generally smaller than Old World monkeys and tend to live in diverse habitats, from tropical rainforests to savannas. <br>
                        Their social structures can vary widely, and many species exhibit complex behaviors, including vocal communication and tool use.</p>

                <div id="Lesser">
                    <p>
                        Lesser apes, including gibbons and siamangs, belong to the family Hylobatidae. <br>
                        They are smaller than great apes and are known for their distinctive vocalizations and agility in trees. <br>
                        Lesser apes primarily inhabit the forests of Southeast Asia and are highly social, often living in monogamous pairs or small family groups. <br>
                        They are excellent climebers, using their long arms to swing between branches. <br>
                        Their diets mainly consist of fruits, leaves, and insects. Lesser apes play a crucial role in their ecosystems as seed dispersers.</p>

                <div id="Great">
                    <p>
                        Great apes, part of the family Hominidae, include orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos, and humans. <br>
                        They are characterized by their larger size, advanced cognitive abilities, and more complex social structures compared to lesser apes. <br>
                        Great apes exhibit a wide range of behaviors, including tool use, communication, and social bonding. <br>
                        They primarily inhabit forests and savannas in Africa and Asia, with diets that vary from fruits and leaves to insects and small animals excluding humans. <br>
                        Great apes are also known for their close genetic relationship to us, sharing a significant percentage of DNA, which has implications for understanding evolution and behavior. <br>
                        Conservation efforts are critical for their survival, as many species face threats from habitat loss and poaching. </p>
