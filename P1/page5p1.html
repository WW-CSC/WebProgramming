            <h3>Great Ape familys</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ponginae</li>
                <li>Gorilli</li>
                <li>Panaia</li>

            <p>
                Great apes are humans closest ancestors. All of them share at least 97% of dna with us. <br>
                There behaviours and social interactions allow us to understand our own behaviours better. <br>
                Like humans great apes have relativly large brains which allows for great cognative abilitys and use of things like tools.

            <h3>The sub familys</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Ponginae</h4>
                    <p>
                        This genus has two sub species <br>
                        The bornean Orangutan Pongo pygmaeus and Sumatran Orangutan Pongo abelii. <br>
                        Orangutans have long arms, short legs, and a distinctive body shape suited for an arboreal lifestyle. <br>
                        Males can weigh between 110 to 200 pounds, while females are smaller. <br>
                        They are known for their intelligence and ability to use tools, such as using sticks to extract insects or leaves to collect water. <br>

                <li>
                    <h4>Gorilli</h4>
                    <p>
                        This genus has two sub species the western Gorilla and the Estern Gorilla. <br>
                        Gorillas are the largest living primates, with males "silverbacks" weighing between 300 to 500 pounds. <br>
                        Gorillas inhabit tropical forests in Central and West Africa, with the Western Gorilla found in lowland rainforests and the Eastern Gorilla in mountainous regions. <br>
                        Both species are endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and diseases like Ebola. Conservation efforts are crucial to their survival. <br>

                    <h4>Panaia</h4>
                    <p>
                        This genus has two sub species as well, being the comman chimpanze and the bonobo, which are our closest lviing ancestors <br>
                        Chimpd are found across West and Central Africa, and are known for there complex social structures and tool use. <br>
                        Bonobos aer located in the Congo Basin, they are often distinguished by their more peaceful social behavior and matriarchal societies. <br>
                        Chimpanzees are robust and have long arms, while bonobos are generally smaller and have a more slender build. Both species have large brains relative to body size. <br>

                    <h4>Homo</h4>
                    <p>
                        This is us. We are the only living species left of our genus. There were previously other but all have gone exstinct. <br>
                        Humans are the most succsesfull primate and animal in the world. Our reach cover all seven continets and we live on six. <br>
                        What set us apart from our competition was our big brain as comparativly we are very weak, the average human would get deystroyed by a Chimp. <br>
                        We are so succsesfull that now we spend our time doing things other than just surviving. <br>
