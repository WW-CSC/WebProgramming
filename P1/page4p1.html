                Lesser apes belong to the family Hylobatidae, which includes several genera and species. <br>
                Lesser apes are known for their distinctive brachiation locomotion, social structures, and vocalizations. <br>
                They're  mostly found in the forests of Southeast Asia. They are normally refered to as Gibbons.

                    <h4>Hylobates</h4><br>
                    Hylobates is a genus of small apes. and are known for their distinctive vocalizations, which are often referred to as "songs." <br>
                    They are typically monogamous and live in small family groups. Gibbons play an important role in their ecosystems as seed dispersers. <br>

                    <h4>Symphalangus</h4><br>
                    Symphalangus is a genus of gibbons, commonly known as siamangs. <br>
                    siamangs are notable for their larger size compared to other gibbons and their distinctive throat sac, which enables them to produce deep, resonant calls. <br>
                    Unfortunately, they are threatened by habitat loss and illegal hunting, leading to declining populations. <br>

                    <h4>Nomascus</h4><br>
                    Nomascus is a genus of gibbons known as the crested gibbons, known for their striking fur, which often features a distinctive crest on their heads. <br>
                    Nomascus species are smaller than siamangs and exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males typically having darker fur than females. <br>
                    Like other gibbons, Nomascus species are primarily frugivorous and depend on forest habitats, making them vulnerable to threats such as habitat destruction and poaching. <br>

            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                Many gibbon species are endangered due to habitat destruction, deforestation, and hunting as well as the pet trade all poses a significant threat. <br>
