            <h3>New world familys</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cercopithecinae</li>
                <li>Colobinae</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Locations of habitaion</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Middle east</li>
                <li>South asia</li>
                <li>East Asia</li>
                <li>Sub Sahran Africa</li>
                <li>Gibralta and north Morroco</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Most Old World monkeys have tails the family name means "tailed ape", unlike the tailless apes. <br>
                The tails of Old World monkeys are not prehensile, unlike those of the New World monkeys (platyrrhines). <br>
                This just means that they cannot use thier tails as an extra limb while climbing.

            <h3>Some of the sub familys</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><h4>Baboons</h4><p> 
                    Baboons are large, social primates belonging to the genus Papio. They are native to Africa and parts of Arabia. <br> 
                    Baboons are known for their strong social structures, often living in troops led by a dominant male. 
                    Characterized by their long snouts, powerful limbs, and distinctive facial features, baboons have a diet that is omnivorous.
                    Their adaptability and intelligence allow them to navigate complex social interactions and environmental challenges. </p>

                </li>
                <li><h4>Mandrills/Drills</h4><p>
                    Mandrills and drills are two closely related species within the genus Mandrillus, both known for their striking appearance and social behavior. <br>
                    They are often mistaken for baboons those who don't realise. Found in central and west Africa. <br>
                    Mandrills are notable for their vibrant coloration, especially the males, which have blue and red facial stripes and large, colorful rumps. <br>
                    They are among the largest monkeys in the world. <br>
                    Drills resemble mandrills but have a more subdued coloration, with a less pronounced facial pattern and a more uniform body color

                </li>
                <li><h4>Maqacues</h4><p> 
                    Macaques are a diverse group belonging to the genus Macaca, found primarily across Asia and North Africa. <br>
                    They are adaptable, inhabiting various environments, from forests and mountains to urban areas. <br>
                    Macaques are known for their intelligence and problem-solving abilities. <br>
                    They exhibit a wide range of behaviors, from playful interactions to sophisticated social hierarchies. <br>
                    Some species, like the rhesus macaque, have adapted well to human environments, often foraging in urban areas.
